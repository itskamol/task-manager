## ü§ñ Testing the AI Features

### Test AI Task Creation

```
/add Complete project documentation with examples and deployment guide
```

The AI will analyze this and suggest:

- Priority: HIGH (due to complexity)
- Deadline: Based on task scope
- Estimated time: Based on content analysis

### Test Reporting

```
/daily_report
```

Will show:

- Today's completed tasks
- Productivity score
- AI-generated insights in Uzbek
- Recommendations for improvement

### Test Analytics

```
/analytics
```

Will show:

- Productivity trends
- Task completion rates
- Category analysis
- Streak information

## üîç AI Prompts Used

The system uses sophisticated prompts in Uzbek to generate contextual insights:

### Priority Analysis

- Analyzes keywords like "urgent", "important", "deadline"
- Considers task complexity and scope
- Returns priority with reasoning

### Deadline Suggestions

- Considers task type and complexity
- Suggests realistic timeframes
- Factors in user's timezone

### Insights Generation

- Analyzes completion patterns
- Identifies productivity trends
- Provides actionable recommendations in Uzbek

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Gemini API Errors**

    - Check if API key is correctly set in `.env`
    - Verify API key has proper permissions
    - Check internet connectivity

2. **Database Connection Issues**

    - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
    - Check DATABASE_URL format
    - Run `npx prisma migrate dev`

3. **Redis Connection Issues**
    - Ensure Redis is running
    - Check REDIS_URL format
    - Test with `redis-cli ping`

### Fallback Behavior

If Gemini AI is unavailable, the system automatically falls back to:

- Default priority assignment based on keywords
- Standard deadline calculations
- Basic time estimations
- Simple completion statistics

## üìä Reports Structure

### Daily Report

- Tasks completed today
- Productivity score (0-100)
- Current streak
- AI insights in Uzbek

### Weekly Report

- Week's completion rate
- Most productive days
- Category analysis
- Trend comparison
- AI-powered weekly insights

### Monthly Report

- Monthly productivity trends
- Goal achievement analysis
- Habit formation insights
- Category performance
- Monthly recommendations

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Configure Environment**: Set up all API keys and database connections
2. **Test Basic Features**: Create tasks and test AI suggestions
3. **Test Reporting**: Generate reports and review AI insights
4. **Customize Prompts**: Modify AI prompts for your specific needs
5. **Monitor Performance**: Check AI response times and accuracy

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

The AI system learns from user patterns and can be enhanced by:

- Adjusting prompts based on user feedback
- Adding more sophisticated analysis algorithms
- Integrating additional data sources
- Expanding language support beyond Uzbek
